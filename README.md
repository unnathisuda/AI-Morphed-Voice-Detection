The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have enabled the creation of highly realistic voice impersonation systems, such as deepfakes and synthetic voice generators. While these technologies offer innovative applications, they pose significant security and ethical challenges, especially in areas like fraud, identity theft, and misinformation. This project focuses on developing an AI-based voice impersonation detection system to identify synthetic or impersonated audio.
The proposed solution leverages deep learning models trained on features such as spectrogram analysis, pitch variations, and phoneme distribution. By comparing voice characteristics against established baselines, the system identifies anomalies indicative of generated or manipulated audio. The detection framework incorporates real-time processing capabilities, making it suitable for applications in telecommunication, financial verification systems, and online content authentication.
This project aims to contribute to safeguarding digital integrity by providing a reliable tool to detect and mitigate the misuse of AI-generated voice technologies.
